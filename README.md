# PuzzleGame
A clone of a certain popular puzzle game created using C++ and SDL2.

The code in this project is covered under the GNU GPL 2 license - use it as you wish :)

To build and run on Linux simply navigate to the Linux folder from your terminal and run the build.sh script. Then type "./tetris" to run. The project requires SDL2 so be sure you have the appropriate libraries on your machine. "sudo apt-get libsdl2\*" on Debian based systems should sort it if you're feeling lazy :P

Project also contains a Visual Studio solution for running on Windows.
